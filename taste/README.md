# Taste

Inspired by one scene in Ratatouille, taste aims at visualizing the taste of food using colors and movements of particles. All effects are realized by physical simulations 
using p5.js. Through this project I would like to offer an immersive journey for the user to discover tastes of food in a visualized way. The particles have different colors, 
shapes, and movements that represent the taste.
