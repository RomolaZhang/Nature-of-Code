# the Sound of Poseidon

Poseidon is the god of the sea in ancient Greek myth. The Sound of Poseidon brings sound and water movement together. It is a set of interactive 3D musical fountains that visualize sound and music by changing the color, movement, 
and oscillation of several particle systems (as water drops). The audience can give a sound or music through microphone, and see how it affects the fountains.
