This is actually an experiment. This prompt of my "video games as art" final project asks us to push the boundary of video games in a conceptual way, and 
I thought of people's romantic imagination of death scenes (probably impressed by John Keats' Ode to a Nightingale). Could death be romantic, since its actual 
essence is "nothing"? A game would be a good platform to arouse players' comtemplation on death and the paradox.
